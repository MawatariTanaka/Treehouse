Common Assistive Technologies

    Screen magnifier: used to enlarge content for users with sight impairments
    Switch controls: a switch allows users with motor impairments to control your site without the use of a touchscreen, mouse, or keyboard
    Closed captioning: used to make videos accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing users, as well as users with Auditory Processing Disorder

    Vocabulary
        Accessible design: a design process in which the needs of people with disabilities are specifically considered
        Curb-cut effect: the idea that accessibility has benefits beyond allowing people with disabilities to use your product
